# 📦 Dropbox Brand Clone – Kraftbase Frontend Assignment

This project is a frontend clone of the [Dropbox Brand site](https://brand.dropbox.com), built as part of the Kraftbase assignment. The focus is on clean architecture, responsive design, and smooth animations using modern frontend tools.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Next.js** – React framework with SSR and routing out of the box
- **TypeScript** – Strong typing and better developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first CSS for fast and responsive design
- **Framer Motion** – Declarative animations and smooth transitions

## 📌 Why These Tools?

- **Next.js:** Simplifies routing and performance optimization
- **TypeScript:** Helps avoid runtime bugs with static type checking
- **Tailwind CSS:** Enables rapid prototyping with a mobile-first approach
- **Framer Motion:** Ideal for smooth and easy-to-implement animations

## 🚀 Features Implemented

- Clean landing page structure
- Smooth entry animations using Framer Motion
- Mobile-responsive layout
- Component-based architecture
- Static image placeholders used for canvas-based animations (as per instruction)

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- Some complex animations and canvas elements are replaced with static assets/GIFs
- Feature scope focused on a clean, functional milestone over completeness due to time constraints

## 💡 Challenges Faced

- Learning and implementing Framer Motion effectively in a real UI
- Balancing between animation complexity and clean delivery in a short timeline

## 📁 Project Structure

- `components/` – Reusable components
- `app/` – Next.js app directory
- `public/` – Static assets
- `next.config.ts` – Next.js configuration

## 🙏 Thanks

Thank you Kraftbase team for this opportunity. I’ve focused on delivering clean code with attention to detail and would love a chance to improve and grow further with the team.
